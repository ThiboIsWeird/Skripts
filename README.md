# Skripts
- This is a place where I'm going to upload my skripts so no one can steal my hard work.

# Skripts Info
- These skripts do not contain anything that may harm your server.
- These skripts have been created to not lag out servers but if you push the boundaries of your minecraft server yourself (eg. placing 1m blocks in 1 go with skript) then that's not my problem.

# Skript Usage
- In the folders you may find a file called plugins.md, in here you'll find the required plugins for the specific skript to work, the links might be outdated but I'll do my best to keep the updated.
- You may not sell/distribute my skripts without my consent, you may use my skripts for personal inquires and you may change the code yourself but keep in mind that I won't provide support if you've heavily changed the skript!

- That's all, now have fun with my skripts!
